# Sabbatical Policy

To reward employees who have been with DevMynd for a significant period of time, DevMynd offers employees an option to take a sabbatical.  This gives employees an opportunity to explore new skills, cultures, and ideas. Sabbaticals bring creativity and innovation back to DevMynd upon an employee’s return.

### Who and how long
Employees who have been with the company for **at least 3 years and 9 months**, can take up to **8 consecutive weeks of unpaid leave**. 

A sabbatical can be taken once for every 4 years of employment and once within a single 4 year period.

Sabbatical time is inclusive of weekends and company holidays.  In other words, if a company holiday occurs during a sabbatical, it does not increase the total time the sabbatical can be taken.


### Benefits during sabbatical
Employee health insurance and some benefits will be maintained and paid by DevMynd during this period to the extent allowed by the insurance contract.  Employees will still be able to use their health insurance and access funds in their pre-tax accounts, such as HSA, Transit, and 401(k). Pre-tax deductions will be stopped during the sabbatical and will need to be restarted upon return.

If an employee does not return to work or leaves the company within the 6 months following the leave, they will need to pay the company back for the cost of benefits, including administrative upkeep of pre-tax accounts, during their leave. 

No PTO or sick time is accrued during a sabbatical. PTO accrued within the same year as the sabbatical cannot be rolled over to the next year.  Sabbaticals cannot happen consecutively with PTO. Sabbatical time and PTO must be at least 4 weeks apart. 

### Notification and approval
Employees must notify their manager a minimum of 8 weeks in advance of taking a sabbatical. Because sabbaticals effect DevMynd’s project schedules, clients expectations and cash flow, the sabbatical timing may need to be adjusted and in rare cases may be denied.

Once a sabbatical is approved, employees are expected to proactively communicate with their team, clients, and management about the sabbatical, delegation of work and when they will return.  Employees are encouraged to continue to write blog posts for DevMynd and otherwise contribute to and engage with the DevMynd community.

### Other Employment

While on leave, employees may not apply for unemployment insurance. Employees may not accept any work as employees or contractors for more than 20 hours per week during their sabbatical. If you take employment of any kind, it must be approved by your manager.  Outside employment should meet the restrictions in the non-solicit section of your employment contract, and must not conflict in any way with your responsibilities within our company. Employees may not work for competitors or clients, nor take an ownership position with a competitor.
