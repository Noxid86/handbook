# Health and Disability Insurance

DevMynd's standard benefits package includes 100% employer-paid policies for medical, dental, and vision insurance, short and long-term disability insurance, and life insurance.  Coverage includes employees, spouses, and families.  All of the company's policies are managed through our HR Management software, [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/).

While we make every attempt to select insurance carriers that offer the widest network of providers it is impossible for us to accommodate every healthcare provider.  From time to time we may switch carriers.  At these times we will take a poll of the employees to evaluate whether new networks have adequate coverage.
