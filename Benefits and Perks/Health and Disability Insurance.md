# Health and Disability Insurance

DevMynd's standard benefits package includes 100% employer-paid policies for medical, dental, and vision insurance, short and long-term disability insurance, and life insurance.  Coverage includes employees, spouses, and families.  All of the company's policies are managed through our HR Management software, [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/).

While we make every attempt to select insurance carriers that offer the widest network of providers it is impossible for us to accommodate every healthcare provider.  From time to time we may switch carriers.  At these times we will take a poll of the employees to evaluate whether new networks have adequate coverage.  The choice of carrier will factor in the provider network but will also be informed by economics.

[TODO: find out if the policy below is allowed under ACA]
If you chose not to participate in the company's health care plan, and are not covered by another policy (for example through a spouse or other family member), you may elect to receive a monthly stipend in the amount of 50% of what your premiums would have been under the company insurance policy.  This stipend is to be used expressly for the purpose of purchasing your own health insurance.  This stipend only applies to health coverage, it does not apply if you choose not to enroll in dental, vision, or other insurances offered by DevMynd.
