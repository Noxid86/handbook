# Paid Time Off

## Vacation

Each employee at (other than apprentices) starts their employment with 3 weeks of paid time off (PTO) and earns an additional week of employment each year up to 5 weeks.  Vacation time should be requested with as much advanced notice as possible through the company's HR system, [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/).

When vacation time is requested, it will be reviewed by your manager.  Every attempt will be made to approve all time off requests, but in rare cases where it significantly impacts business operation we may ask for adjustments to be made.  It is the employee's responsibility to notify their team lead, clients, and any other necessary party of any outages as soon as possible.

PTO renews on the calendar year.  Employees who start employment mid-year will receive a pro-rated amount of PTO through the end of their first partial year of employment.  Up to 40 hours of unused PTO may be rolled over from one year to the next.

## Sick Days

Sick days are considered PTO and should be recorded as such in the company's HR system, [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/).

## Unpaid Time Off

The company does not have a specific policy regarding unpaid time off.  If you feel that you need to exceed your available paid time off please consult with the management team.

## Standard and Floating Holidays

In addition to PTO for vacation, there are several standard holidays which all employees receive off and two floating holidays which may be taken by the employee at any time.  The standard holidays are:

* Labor Day
* The 4th of July
* Memorial Day
* Thanksgiving Day
* New Years Day

Floating days are often used for Christmas but may be used for other personal holidays or for New Years Eve, etc.

## Termination Payout

When an employee leaves the company voluntarily, they will be paid out for any unused PTO in accordance with their current salary.
