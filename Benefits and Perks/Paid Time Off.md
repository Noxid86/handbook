# Paid Time Off

## Vacation

Each employee (other than apprentices) starts their employment with 3 weeks of paid time off (PTO) and earns an additional week of PTO each year up to 5 weeks.  Vacation time should be requested with as much advanced notice as possible through the company's HR system, [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/).

When vacation time is requested, it will be reviewed by your manager.  Every attempt will be made to approve all time off requests, but in rare cases where it significantly impacts business operation we may ask for adjustments to be made.  It is the employee's responsibility to notify their team lead, clients, and any other necessary party of any outages as soon as possible.

PTO renews on the calendar year.  Employees who start employment mid-year will receive a pro-rated amount of PTO through the end of their first partial year of employment.  Up to 40 hours of unused PTO may be rolled over from one year to the next.

## Sick Days

Sick days are considered time off and will be reduced from your total available PTO.  All sick days must be recorded as such in the company's HR system, [Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/).

## Conference Days

Development and design employees (including apprentices) receive PTO for 3 conference days annually.  These may be used to attend an industry focused event that must be approved by a manager prior when requesting the time.  These additional PTO days do not roll over to the next year.

## Unpaid Time Off

The company does not have a specific policy regarding unpaid time off.  If you feel that you need to exceed your available PTO please consult with the management team.

## Standard and Floating Holidays

In addition to PTO for vacation and sick days, there are 7 standard holidays which all employees receive off and 1 floating holiday which may be taken at another time of personal importance (often for Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve).

The standard holidays are:

* Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
* Memorial Day
* Independence Day
* Labor Day
* Thanksgiving Day
* Christmas Day
* New Years Day

While DevMynd is generally closed on Christmas day, employees who wish to substitute this day for another day of significance may do so, please work with the HR administrator if this is a concern.


## Termination Payout

When an employee leaves the company voluntarily, they will be paid out for any unused PTO in accordance with their current salary.  Employees who are terminated involunatirly, or for cause, will only be paid out for unused PTO if their state of residence requires such action.
