# Other Perks

## Pre-Tax Transit Benefit

Employees are eligible to receive a pre-tax transit benefit in the amount of $25 per month.  This benefit can be used in one of two ways:

* Applied toward a Ventra account (if in Chicago) or a BART account (if in San Francisco).  These accounts will be handled directly from the company but employees must coordinate with the office manager to get enrolled.
* For bike related purchases (this can be done in one lump rather than monthly if desired).  These purchases would be [expensed with a receipt](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Expense%20Tracking%20and%20Reimbursement.md) and then reimbursed.

## Wellness Benefit

_We are currently exploring options for implementing a wellness program and will have more to share about this soon._
