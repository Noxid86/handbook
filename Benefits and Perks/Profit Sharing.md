# Profit Sharing

Each month, the company will reserve a portion of company profit according to the table below.  The reserved funds will be held in an account until the next profit sharing distribution at which time all funds in the program will be distributed.  Profit sharing distributions are made twice annually on or around April 10th and October 10th.

The amount of profit reserved depends on the company's performance in the given month based on a tiered scale:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Overall Company Profit Margin</b></td>
    <td><b>Percent of Profit Reserved</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10% or Less</td>
    <td>10% Reserved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10-20%</td>
    <td>15% Reserved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20% or Higher</td>
    <td>20% Reserved</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Employees are eligible to receive distributions from the company's profit sharing program after 1 full year of employment which must occur prior to the distribution date.  For employees who began as apprentices, their first year is counted from their graduation date.

The program revolves around a point system.  On an employee's first
anniversary date they receive 5,000 points in the program.  At each
subsequent anniversary date they receive an additional 1,000 points for
each year of employment.  For example, an employee who has been at the
company for 4 years would have seen their points increase in the
following progression:

* 1st Anniversary: 5,000
* 2nd Anniversary: an additional 2,000 for a total of 7,000
* 3rd Anniversary: an additional 3,000 for a total of 10,000
* 4th Anniversary: an additional 4,000 for a total of 14,000

Points are recorded in a spreadsheet which is available for review by any person who is currently eligible for the program.

At the date of the distribution each person will receive a share of the profit sharing fund equal to the percentage of the total points which they currently hold.  Payments will be made through the normal ACH payroll process and all appropriate taxes will be withheld.
