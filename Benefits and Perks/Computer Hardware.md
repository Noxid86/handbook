# Computer Hardware

Every team member at DevMynd has a choice in their computing environment and hardware.  We generally prefer Apple hardware and Mac OSX operating systems, but this should not prevent individuals from choosing what helps them be effective at their work.

Employees have three options for hardware:

**1. Company Provided (owned) Hardware**

If you elect to have the company purchase a computer for you we purchase a standard machine: a 13" Macbook Pro w/ Retina Display, 512Gb of storage, and 16Gb of RAM.

**2. Company Provided (owned) Hardware with Upgrades**

If the specifications of the standard company laptop above are not adequate, you may elect to have the company upgrade this device or purchase another machine. However, any cost in excess of the device described above will be at your expense and will be property of the company.

**3. Bring Your Own Device**

You may bring your own device to use for work provided that this device complies with the [privacy and security](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Privacy%20and%20Security.md) policies of the company including inspection upon request and encryption.

## Upgrade Cycle

All company owned laptops are replaced every 24 months with equivalent versions.

## Purchase at End-of-life

When company owned hardware reaches end-of-life it may be purchased by anyone at the company at the equivalent market value. We typically use [Gazelle](https://www.gazelle.com/) to set market price. The company may occasionally retain spare machines that will not be for sale.

## Inventory

Any company computer hardware over $300 in value should be reported to the office manager for inclusion in the inventory manifest for insurance purposes.
