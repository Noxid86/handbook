# Conferences and Continuing Education

One of our core values is "continuous improvement" so it’s important that we support our employees’ efforts to learn, grow, and improve. These are some of the key benefits of working at DevMynd, and are central to our company culture.

## Learning Budget

Every developer or designer at DevMynd has an annual budget of $750 to spend on learning activities related to their work.  This budget can be spent on classes, online training, books, screencasts, etc.  It may also be used for attending conferences and applied to conference registration fees and appropriate travel expenses.

The learning budget is accounted for through the [expense tracking](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Expense%20Tracking%20and%20Reimbursement.md)
system which means that you will pay for these expenses and then submit for reimbursement.  It is recommended that you check with someone from the management team before making a purchase which you would like to apply towards your learning budget.

The learning budget renews at the first of the year.  Employees who join the company mid-year will have a pro-rated learning budget.  Unused portions of the learning budget do not roll over to future years.

## Speaker Support

It makes DevMynd look great when our team members speak at industry conferences, so we love to support them when they are invited or accepted to speak.  For each event, DevMynd will pay for flights and hotel up to $1,000 and employees are eligible for this benefit up to 3 times each year.

Employees are encouraged to work with team leads, management, and the sales team if they plan to submit to speak at a conference.  This will help us ensure that there are not schedule conflicts and that appropriate opportunities to support the speaker are made.

Reimbursement for speaker support is accounted for through the [expense tracking](mynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Expense%20Tracking%20and%20Reimbursement.md) system which means that you will pay for these expenses and then submit for reimbursement.
