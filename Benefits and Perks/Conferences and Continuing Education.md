# Conferences and Continuing Education

Continuous improvement is one of our [core values](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Values.md#continuous-improvement), so we support our employees' efforts to learn, grow, and improve. These are some of the key benefits of working at DevMynd, and are central to our company culture.

## Learning Budget

Every developer or designer at DevMynd has an annual budget of $1,000 to spend on learning activities related to their work. You can spend this budget on classes, online training, books, screencasts, etc.

You can also use the learning budget to attend industry related  conferences.  The budget can be applied to 100% of conference registration fees and 50% of travel expenses (flights and hotel) but it does not cover meals and other incidental costs.

The learning budget is accounted for through the [expense tracking](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Expense%20Tracking%20and%20Reimbursement.md)
system, which means that you pay for these expenses and then submit a receipt to receive reimbursement. Please check with someone from the management team before making a purchase that you would like to apply towards your learning budget.

The learning budget renews at the first of the year. Employees who join the company mid-year will have a pro-rated learning budget. Unused portions of the learning budget do not roll over to future years.

## Speaker Support

It makes DevMynd look great when our team members speak at industry conferences, so we love to support them when they are invited or accepted to speak. For each event, DevMynd will pay for flights and hotel up to $1,000 and employees are eligible for this benefit up to 3 times each year.

Employees are encouraged to work with team leads, management, and the sales team if they plan to submit to speak at a conference. This will help us ensure that there are not schedule conflicts and that we can appropriately support you.

Reimbursement for speaker support is accounted for through the [expense tracking](mynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Expense%20Tracking%20and%20Reimbursement.md) system, which means that you pay for these expenses and then submit receipts to receive reimbursement.
