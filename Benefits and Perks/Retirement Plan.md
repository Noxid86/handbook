# Retirement Plan

Employees are eligible to join the company's Simple IRA retirement plan after their first full six months of employment.  For employees who began as apprentices, their six months begins at their graduation date.  The company will offer a matching contribution to the IRA account up to 3% of an employee's salary.  Adjustments to contributions to the IRA may only be made once per month and should be made as early in the month as possible to ensure they can be submitted in a timely manner.
