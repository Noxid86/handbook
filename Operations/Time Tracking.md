# Time Tracking

We bill customers on a fixed weekly rate rather than hourly.  This makes the billing process very predictable for customers and preserves a measure of flexibility for us in terms of staffing.  When an outage occurs for PTO or sick time we credit clients back for those days.

In order to have an accurate picture of our costs and where we are spending time we ask that everyone follow some guidelines for keeping track of time.

## When Assigned to a Single Project

On days that you **work for this project**, please log straight 8 hours of effort regardless of how you distributed work throughout your day.  Please choose the appropriate task when logging time based on the activity (not what team you are associated with) for example "Research, UX, Design", "Software Development", or "Project Management"

On days that you are **sick, on PTO, or at a conference**, please log 8 hours to the Outage task associated with the project you are assigned to.  This is important because it will continue to associate your time to the project but it will not add billable hours.

## When Assigned to Multiple Projects

On days that you **work for any or all of these projects**, please log a total of 8 hours and allocate them roughly proportionally to the projects you worked on.  For example, if you spent 75% of your day on Project A and 25% on project B you would log maybe 2 hours to Project A and 6 to Project B.  Please do not log overtime, just make sure you're totaling 8 hours.  Please choose the appropriate task when logging time based on the activity (not what team you are associated with) for example "Research, UX, Design", "Software Development", or "Project Management"

On days that you are **sick, on PTO, or at a conference**, please evenly distribute 8 hours across all your projects under the Outage task.  For example, if you are on 2 projects you would just log 4 hours to each for the day that you were out.

## When On the Beach

On days that you are **working but on the beach**, please log a total of 8 hours to the Beach project and choose the task that is relevant to the team you are associated with.

On days that you are **sick, on PTO, or at a conference**, please log a total of 8 hours to the Beach project under the Outage task.

## General Guidelines

If you are at any point unsure of how to interpret these rules or perhaps what projects you are currently assigned to please ask your manager or project lead before logging time.

Lastly, in an effort to more closely follow our projects for account management we would like everyone to enter their time daily if possible but at a minimum before leaving the office each Friday.
