# Feedback

A culture of feedback is the essence of any successful organization, and we want to continually improve both the ways we provide feedback to each other and the quality of that feedback. Our goal is for feedback to flow in all directions of the org chart, not just top-down from the company's management.

Feedback, as we are using the term here, may refer to areas of strength ("I really like the way you organized our JavaScript specs!") or areas of weakness ("You should consider pairing more often"). Both are important, but the latter is generally more difficult to deliver. 

## Ad-hoc Feedback

Anyone should feel comfortable providing feedback to any member of the team.  It is, after all, a part of one of our [core values](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Values.md#open-the-door). We encourage feedback to be given constructively and gently. You can always use our [feedback template](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Feedback/Feedback%20Template.md) to structure the conversation, but an informal chat or a walk around the block may work just as well (or even better). Use your judgement.

If you would like to provide feedback to a team member but don't know how, or don't feel comfortable, please speak with a member of the management team for guidance.

## Biannual Feedback

Twice a year each employee will have an official feedback session with a member of the management team, once near the employee's anniversary date and again six months later. This feedback will consist primarily of peer input gathered and consolidated by the manager who is facilitating the feedback session. In general, these feedback sessions will be a conversation focused on our [feedback template](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Feedback/Feedback%20Template.md).

Our goals for these feedback sessions include:

* Provide candid feedback collected from peers on observations of behavior and impact to the team
* Provide coaching and guidance on how to improve in certain areas
* Set personal goals for the next six months
* Communicate salary adjustments, which occur once a year

## Feedback Template

To help facilitate feedback that is both actionable and aligned with our [core values](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Values.md) we have created a feedback template. We'll use this template when providing biannual feedback, and it may be used more frequently. Not all parts of the template are needed or necessary for every type of feedback; the idea is to provide some structure to otherwise unstructured conversations.

## Monthly One-on-Ones

At least once a month, every team member will meet with a member of management for an informal discussion. This time is about giving team members an opportunity to provide feedback to management. These conversations do not need to be structured, and can be open ended or stick to an agenda, as the team member prefers.

Team members should be prepared to discuss what's on their mind, ways to improve the company and our culture, issues on projects, and anything else that is negatively or positively impacting their time at DevMynd.

## Quarterly Company Meetings

Once each quarter we will gather as a company for a meeting. We will try and schedule times when everyone can be present and therefore these meetings are semi-mandatory. Our goals are to share updates on company performance, inform the team about administrative changes to policies or benefits, and review any other changes to our practices.
