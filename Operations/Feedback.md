# Feedback

A culture of feedback is the essence of any successful organization and we want to continually improve the ways we provide feedback to each other and the quality of that feedback.  It is important to remember that feedback should not just flow top-down from the company's management but it is essential that peers at all levels can provide feedback to each other.

## Ad-hoc Feedback

Anyone should feel comfortable providing feedback to any member of the team.  It is after all one of our [core values](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Values.md#open-the-door).  We encourage all team members to provide feedback to each other constructively and gently.  The feedback template described below is just one possible tool that can be used, but an ad-hoc conversation or walk around the block is just as good.  If you would like to provide feedback to a team member but don't know how or don't feel comfortable please speak with a member of the management team for guidance.

## Biannual Feedback

Twice a year each employee will have an official feedback session with a member of the management team, once near the employee's anniversary date and again six months later.  This feedback will consist primarily of peer input that will be gathered and consolidated by the manager who is facilitating the feedback session.  In general, these feedback sessions will revolve around the feedback template which is described below.

These feedback opportunities accomplish several goals:

* Provide candid feedback collected from peers on observations of behavior and impact to the team
* Provide coaching and guidance on how to improve in certain areas
* Set personal goals for the next six months
* Communicate salary adjustments, which occur once a year

## Feedback Template

To help facilitate feedback that is both actionable and aligned with our [core values](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Values.md) we have created a feedback template.  In particular, we will use this template when providing biannual feedback, though it may be used more frequently.  Not all parts of the template are needed or necessary for every type of feedback, the idea is to provide some structure to otherwise unstructured conversations.

## Monthly One-on-Ones

At least once a month every team member will meet with a member of management for an informal discussion.  This time is more about giving team members an opportunity to provide feedback to management than vice versa.  These conversations do not need to be structured and are open ended.  Team members should be prepared to discuss what's on their mind, ways to improve the company and our culture, issues on projects, or anything else that is negatively or positively impacting their time at DevMynd.

## Quarterly Company Meetings

Once each quarter we will gather as a company for a meeting.  We will try and schedule times when everyone can be present and therefore these meetings are semi-mandatory. The goal will be to share updates on company performance, administrative changes to policies or benefits, and review any other changes to our practices.
