# Feedback: Supports the Customer

[Back to the Feedback Template](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Feedback/Feedback%20Template.md)

We want our customers to be happy with our work, and feel taken care of while we're working with them. It sounds a bit simplistic -- of course we want customers to be happy! -- but in reality, this differentiates DevMynd in the marketplace from most other consulting companies. Many of them just take a spec and build it, whether or not it's the right thing to build.

This set of tactics, then, are what differentiate a consultant from a contractor. We want our employees to be the former.

**1. We want the customer to succeed.**

We're interested in understanding the customer's business and what drives them to build this software. Whatever the customer's goals are, the thing we build should meet them. Often their stated goals at the beginning of a project are not their actual goals, and so even as a project progresses, we remain sensitive to signs that goals have shifted, or become more murky, or become more clear, and we surface those signs both to the larger group and to the customer.

**2. We understand the “why” and not just the “how” of all the stories we work on.**

Developers make hundreds of tiny decisions about features as they build.  Some of them are big enough to prompt a conversation with the customer, but many are not. In order for those tiny decisions to be in alignment with customer desires, we need to make sure we understand both what the story is supposed to do, and why it's important to the customer.

**3. We remain cool under pressure.**

While we want our customers to succeed, we remain emotionally detached from the ultimate success or failure of their projects. Many factors outside of our control may determine whether they can actually do what they're trying to do, and realistically, some projects don't go well.  When that happens, we do the best we can with the situation we have.

**4. We give careful consideration to requested divergences from our quality standards.**

You may remember this tactic from the “Ships Quality Work” section, and the repetition is deliberate. Despite knowing ahead of time that quality code is one of DevMynd's differentiating factors, many customers will press us to compromise for the sake of schedule and/or scope. It's a fine line to walk between customer happiness and developer happiness, and that's why it's in both sections.

**5. We make our work visible.**

We keep tracker up to date, so the customer always knows who's working on what. We apprise them of schedule or personnel changes well in advance. We do a standup with them every day, and we work with them to accept stories promptly. It should always be obvious what state their software is in.

**6. We make sure the customer is never surprised.**

Visibility is important, but it's not enough to make sure that the customer actually knows what's happening. We need their active participation in the process, so we check in as often as is necessary to confirm that they know what's happening.

**7. We complain constructively.**

We all complain about projects -- that's just human nature. Particularly when talking to a customer, though, we make sure that the problem is the focus of the conversation, rather than their behavior. It can help to describe the problem in terms of its impact on us, on third parties, or on the project. Then we seek the customer's help to remedy the situation, or to achieve the goal in a different way, rather than assigning blame and telling them to shape up.

**8. We know when it's time for a change.**

Some projects are more taxing than others, and we all want to do good work. That means that it's inevitable that sometimes we'll get emotionally involved in a project's success, take it personally when customers don't follow our recommendations, or find it difficult to focus on problems over behaviors. Those are all signs that we should request to be transferred to a different project.

Our people (and their sanity) are worth more than the lost income of a reduced-headcount or even canceled project. Don't burn yourself out. Ask for what you need.
