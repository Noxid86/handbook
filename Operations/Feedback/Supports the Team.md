# Feedback: Supports the Team

[Back to the Feedback Template](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Operations/Feedback/Feedback%20Template.md)

One of DevMynd's differentiating factors, both as an employer and as a consulting company, is the power of our team. Developers learn a lot working here, and customers reap the benefits of everyone's experience -- not just that of the folks actually working on their code.

The only reason this is true is because we support each other. But an exhortation to “support each other” is too abstract to really act on. As a result, we've put together this set of tactics developers can use that generally move our team communication in the right direction.

** 1. We are respectful.**

Our ideal conversational style is technically blunt, but personally respectful. When someone says something we disagree with, rather than reacting negatively, we ask ourselves why they might feel that way. Or maybe we ask them!

**2. We ask for help when we need it.**

When we're pairing, we're open about what confuses us and what we haven't seen before. We know that if we struggle with something for 30 minutes and don't make progress, it's time to seek outside advice.

**3. We listen to everyone and are open to having our minds changed.**

We consider everyone's ideas, regardless of experience level, and we actively provide space for everyone to participate. We look for common ground rather than delineating “sides” of a debate.

**4. We change what we're doing when it's not working.**

We acknowledge our mistakes, and our capacity for growth, and we take time to think about whether our actions are having the desired effect.  If they're not, we try something different.

**5. We share what we know.**

Everyone has things they can learn, and everyone has things they can teach. We strengthen the team by deliberately spreading the knowledge we have. This could manifest as an internal wiki page, a lunch & learn, a blog post, or just excitement at demonstrating how something works when we pair.

**6. We encourage each other.**

When we pair, we're interested in, rather than judgemental of, the things that our pair is new to or finds confusing. There's always enough time to dig deep enough for everyone to understand.

**7. We provide constructive and helpful feedback.**

This could be verbal/in-person, or written/asynchronous. “Constructive”
generally means couching negative feedback for another person in terms
of its impact on the speaker, or on third parties.

* Example: for a person who resists pairing (more experienced than you): “I'd love to pair more on this project, because I want to learn how you approach [X]. I know I'll need [X] on future projects.”
* Example: for a person who resists pairing (less experienced than you): “I'd love to pair more on this project because I want to show you how I did [X] on [previous project]. I'd love to get your opinion on that approach.”

**8. We collectively own our success or failure, rather than assigning blame.**

We want everyone to learn, experiment, and grow, and therefore, in some sense, we deliberately provide an environment in which people will make mistakes. When that happens, though, we avoid placing blame. Instead, we work together to figure out how to prevent similar mistakes in the future. We collectively own the responsibility to figure out what we could change to reduce mistakes, while still encouraging this learning and experimentation.
