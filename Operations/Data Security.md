# Data Security

## Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, employees should not open email attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the email appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to DevMynd’s system, inform the management immediately.

## Password Security

Employees may not share passwords related to company business with anyone, including coworkers or family members. Revealing passwords related to company or client systems could allow an outsider to attack DevMynd or its clients, or obtain sensitive information.  We **strongly** recommend that you utilize a password manager such as [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), and use strong passwords for all accounts.

## Production Secrets and Tokens

Any access keys, API tokens, or account passwords related to client projects should be protected. Don't store them in source control and don't send them in email. Text message, iMessage, or on the phone are the best options. 

## HIPAA, PCI, or Other Personal Information

When working with clients who are required by law to comply with regulations such as [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act), [PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard), or [FERPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act), do everything you can to avoid needing sensitive data to be present on company hardware. If it is absolutely necessary for company hardware to contain sensitive data, first notify a member of the management team for approval. Never provide or accept this information via email -- only through encrypted channels. Once the data on the machine, encrypt it at rest, and delete it as soon as it is no longer essential. 

## Laptop Encryption and Security

All employees **must** keep the hard disks on their computers encrypted, OR keep all work related content (including source code) on an encrypted partition.  This requirement applies equally to company owned devices or to personal devices being used for company purposes. Put a strong password on all computers, and require it both at login and when the computer goes to sleep or is otherwise left unattended.

## Breaches or Loss of Data

Information provided to DevMynd by its clients is covered under strict non-disclosure agreements and all breaches must be communicated and handled expeditiously. This applies to any scenario in which you believe that sensitive information may have become available to outside parties.

If any company device or personal device being used for company purposes is lost or stolen, bring it to the attention of the management team immediately.
