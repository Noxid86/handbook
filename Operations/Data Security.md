# Data Security

## Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, employees should not open email attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the email appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to DevMynd’s system, you must inform the management immediately.

## Password Security

Employees may not share passwords related to company business with anyone, including coworkers or family members. Revealing passwords related to company or client systems could allow an outsider to attack DevMynd or its clients, or obtain sensitive information.  We **strongly** recommend that you utilize a password manager such as [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) and use strong passwords for all accounts.

## Production Secrets and Tokens

Any access keys, API tokens, or account passwords related to client projects should be protected.  These should **not** be stored in source control and should not be transmitted in clear text over email.  Ideally, DevMynd team members would not have access to production secrets or would limit access to these during development only.

## HIPAA, PCI, or Other Personal Information

When working with clients who are required by law to comply with regulations such as [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act), [PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard), or [FERPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act), the DevMynd team should take care never to possess sensitive data on company hardware.  If it is absolutely necessary for company hardware to contain personal information or production data this information should be deleted as soon as it is no longer essential.  Additionally, this information should never be provided over email and only over encrypted channels.  Further, it should always be encrypted while at rest.  Lastly, if personal or production data is needed a member of the management team should be notified.

## Laptop Encryption and Security

All employees **must** keep the hard disks on their computers encrypted, OR keep all work related content (including source code) on an encrypted partition.  This requirement applies equally to company owned devices or to personal devices being used for company purposes.  All computers should have a strong password which is required at login and also on a regular basis when the computer goes to sleep or is otherwise left unattended for a period of time.

## Breaches or Loss of Data

Information provided to DevMynd by it's clients is covered under strict non-disclosure agreements and all breeches must be communicated and handled expeditiously.  This applies to any scenario in which you believe that sensitive information may have become available to the public.

If any company computer or personal computer being used for company purposes is lost or stolen this must be brought to the attention of the management immediately.
