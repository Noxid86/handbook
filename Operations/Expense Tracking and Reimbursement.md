# Expense Tracking and Reimbursement

## Expense Tracking

Reimbursable expenses should be logged in [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/).  If you don't have access to Expensify please contact the office manager.  Expenses should be entered within 30 days of the receipt date.  Any expense over $25 must have an accompanying receipt, Expensify makes this easy with their mobile app.

## Reimbursement

Expense reimbursement payments are made through ACH at the end of each month.  You can track which expenses have been reimbursed through Expensify.

## Client Billable Expenses

Expenses that should be billable to a client should be approved by the project lead and client in advance and marked as "billable" in Expensify.  Some examples of billable expenses are:

* Software or online services purchased exclusively for client use
* Materials or digital assets (fonts, graphics, etc) used in client projects
* Pre-approved travel expenses: flights, hotels, cabs, and meals while away from your home office

Note: meals that do not include a client and that were not incurred while traveling away from your home office are not reimbursable as they would be incurred during normal circumstances.

## Non-Billable Expenses

Non-billable expenses are not applied to client invoices and are covered by the company.  Examples of acceptable non-billable expenses are:

* Transportation to client sites and meetings (does not include your regular commute)
* Software licenses/SaaS subscriptions purchased for work purposes
* Meals with clients for sales or work purposes
* Hardware accessories (not laptops or monitors)
* Expenses applied towards your learning budget

All expenses over fifty dollars ($200) must be pre-approved by your manager.
