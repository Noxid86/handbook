# Corporate Credit Cards

Some DevMynd team members may be issued corporate credit cards for use in their work.  These cards fall into two categories: discretionary and operational.  We use different proceedures for the monitoring and handling of these cards depending on the type of card.

## Operational Cards

These cards are issued primarily for the purchase of goods and services that apply to the operations of the company.  Some examples would be:

* Cleaning services
* Office supplies
* Computer equipment
* Subscriptions to online services
* Software
* Sales and marketing events

Charges made on operational cards do not require an accompanying expense report.  Transactions will be reviewed on a monthly basis by management to compare against budget.  However, any charge over $800 must be approved by the CEO or CFO in advance.

## Discretionary Cards

These cards are issued to individuals who frequently make purchases related to their individual jobs.  For example, salespeople who travel regularly or managers who frequently cover employee welfare expenses (lunch, coffee, etc).

Discretionary cards will have monthly alert limits which will indicate large purchases to management as well as hard monthly caps on total spend.  Additionally, any charge over $250 must be approved by the CEO or CFO in advance.

Each month, an expense report will be created for each discretionary cardholder.  This report will include a complete transaction history for that month.  It is expected that receipts and descriptions of each purchse will be added to the report by the cardholder for audit and compliance purposes.
