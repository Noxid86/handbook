# Travel

We don't travel heavily as part of our regular work but will occasionally visit clients in remote cities, travel for sales, attend conferences, or visit other DevMynd offices.  The following policies apply to all travel at DevMynd regardless of the purpose.

## Logistics Booking

All travel expenses to be covered by DevMynd or clients must be booked by the administrative staff on behalf of the employee.  The purpose of this is so that we can manage travel budgets and ensure that travel policies are observed for insurance, liability, and safety concerns.

## Flights

Flights should be booked as far in advance as possible to reduce cost.  Individuals can provide an airline of choice but this airline will only be used if the ticket prices are within reasonable range of the average cost for mainstream airlines. 

When booking travel please provide the administrative staff with your desired flight times with some flexibility.  They will attempt to accommodate desired flight times but will opt for less expensive options if possible.

Flights will be booked in the economy cabin, upgrades are at the individual's expense.  DevMynd will cover one checked bag fee per flight but carryon is preferrable.

## Lodging

Lodging will be in hotels or Airbnb if the individual so desires, however Airbnb rates must be within comparable hotel rates.

When traveling with fellow team members, separate rooms will be booked for each individual.

## Car Travel

It is strongly preferred that individuals use ride-sharing or public transit while traveling for business purposes (even within home regions).

### Rental Cars

If it is absolutely necessary for an employee to rent a car they will need to provide a photo copy of their valid driver's license and up-to-date comprehensive car insurance coverage.  Additional insurance coverage should be purchased through the rental company.

Rentals shall be for economy or compact vehicles, upgrades are at the expense of the individual.

### Fuel Reimbursement

Fuel reimbursement for personal vehicles will be at the federal rate for the calendar year in which the travel occurred.  Fuel reimbursement for rented vehicles will be covered by DevMynd or the client as a travel expense.

### Distracted Driving

DevMynd employees who are driving personal or rented vehicles for company purposes will avoid talking on the phone, sending/reading text messages, or performing other activities considered distracting to the driver.

## Inter-office Travel

There is an inter-office travel budget which will be strictly observed on a monthly basis.  Any request for inter-office travel should be submitted to the administrative staff in advance for approval and booking.

## Billable Travel

All travel on behalf of clients should be approved by the client prior to booking.  It is DevMynd's policy that all travel for ongoing engagements be covered by the client.  Please keep in mind that additional restrictions on travel may be imposed by the client so please check with the account manger for details.
