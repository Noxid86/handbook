# Acknowledgement of Receipt of DevMynd Team Handbook

I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the DevMynd Team Handbook, have read it, and understand its provisions.  I further understand that if I have a question, I am obligated to ask a member of the management team for clarification of any provisions in the handbook.

I further understand that the statements contained in the handbook do not create any contractual or other legal obligations of employment.  I also understand that DevMynd may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the handbook, except for its policy of at-will employment.

I understand and agree that my employment with DevMynd is at-will and can be terminated by either me or the company without cause or notice and that nothing in the handbook should be interpreted to the contrary.

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the handbook.
