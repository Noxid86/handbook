## Belief

_**We believe software is for people, and we believe that well-crafted software makes life better.**_

_"software for people"_

We believe that building and using software is a human activity. The stated purpose of a piece of software might be business, social change, entertainment, or communication, but the important part is always people.

_"well-crafted software"_

We believe that the care we put in to designing software leads directly to a high-quality user experience. The techniques we choose to build software are important.

_"makes life better"_

We believe that software can and should improve the world, by increasing commerce, connecting people, or in some other way benefiting society.

## Mission

Our mission is to help clients leverage custom software to solve business and social challenges through a co-creative process that results in meaningful improvements in the lives of users and the effectiveness of business.
