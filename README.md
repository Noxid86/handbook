# DevMynd Team Handbook

When we started DevMynd our goals were very simple: build a company we
wanted to work at and build things that were interesting and meaningful.
Part of growing into a company that we want to work at is developing a
set of policies and guidelines that codify our values - this handbook is
just that.

We are not the first to make our company handbook available as open
source.  But, we liked the idea so much that we decided to follow in
others' footsteps.  Making these documents publicly available signals
our values both internally and to the outside world and it encourages us
to maintain discipline and accountability for the things we believe.
