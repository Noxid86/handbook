# Beliefs, Mission, and Strategy

## Belief

**We believe that well crafted experiences have a profound impact on life, society, and business.  In particular, we believe this impact is most meaningful in the areas of health, education, safety, sustainability, and nourishment (the Impact Sector).**

The purpose of a product may be business, social change, entertainment, or communication, but the important part is always the people.

We believe that for a product to be perceived as high quality it must have a strong business strategy, be solidly engineered, and delight its users in how it works, looks, and feels.

We believe that software products can and should improve the world by increasing commerce, connecting people, or in some other way benefiting society.

## Mission

Our mission is to help our clients reach their most ambitious goals by identifying new opportunities, conceiving solutions, bringing them to life in software, platforms, and services; and enabling them to work better and achieve more.

## Strategy

Our strategy is to seamlessly integrate the practices of business strategy, human-centered research, UX/UI design, and agile software development; and to pursue meaningful work in the Impact Sector.
