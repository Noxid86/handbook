# Beliefs, Vision, and Mission

## Belief

_**We believe that software is for people and that well-crafted software makes life better.**_

_"software for people"_

The purpose of a product may be business, social change, entertainment, or communication, but the important part is always the people.

_"well-crafted software"_

We believe that for a product to be perceived as high quality it must have a strong business strategy, be solidly engineered, and delight its users.

_"makes life better"_

We believe that software products can and should improve the world by increasing commerce, connecting people, or in some other way benefiting society.
