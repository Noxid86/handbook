# DevMynd Values

## Ship Quality Work

We take pride in our work and strive for sustainable and maintainable solutions. We resist compromise, attend to detail, and validate our work.

## Open the Door

We help each other, we value diversity, and we are inclusive. We provide feedback and encouragement constructively, gently, and often. Above all, we work together.

## Remain Optimistic

We want everyone on the team to enjoy their work. We remain cool under pressure. We talk about what needs fixing, and we fix it.

## Act with Integrity

We believe in radical honesty and transparency with our clients. We do the right thing for the project, even when itâ€™s the hard thing. We strive to be trustworthy.

## Focus on Business Value

The DevMynd team gets stuff done! We value true understanding of our customer's business. We help them find the right solution for their problem - even if it's not what they expected.

## Continuously Improve

We learn - and we teach - every day. We grow our junior developers through apprenticeship. We strive to make experimentation and learning, for everyone on the team, both expected and safe.
