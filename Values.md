# DevMynd Values

## Ship Quality Work

We take pride in our work and strive for sustainable and maintainable solutions. We resist shortcuts, attend to detail, and validate our work.

## Open the Door

We help each other, we value diversity, and we are inclusive. We provide feedback and encouragement constructively, gently, and often. Above all, we work together.

## Rise to Challenge

We believe that obstacles are a path to growth. We remain cool under pressure. We talk about what needs fixing, and we work together to fix it.

## Act with Integrity

We believe in the value of honesty and candor. We do the right thing for the team and the project, even when itâ€™s the hard thing. We strive to be trustworthy.

## Focus on Business Value

The DevMynd team gets stuff done! We value true understanding of our customer's business. We help them find the right solution for their problem - even if it's not what they expected.

## Continuously Improve

We learn - and we teach - every day. We grow our junior developers through apprenticeship. We strive to make experimentation and learning, for everyone on the team, both expected and safe.
