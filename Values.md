# DevMynd Values


## Ship Quality Work

We take pride in our workmanship and strive for sustainable and maintainable solutions. We resist compromise, “measure twice, cut once”, attend to detail, and validate our work.

## Open the Door

Our team members help others before ourselves. We are inclusive and value diversity. Feedback and encouragement is provided constructively and gently. We always work together.

## Remain Optimistic

The team at DevMynd enjoys their work. We have learned to remain cool under pressure and to fix things rather than complain about them.

## Act with Integrity

We are highly visible, and we don't hide. We tend to over-communicate. We believe in doing the right thing, especially when it’s the hard thing, and to always be trustworthy.

## Focus on Business Value

The DevMynd team gets stuff done! We say “no” when it’s right for the customer, and say “yes” whenever we can. We become experts in your business and are true consultants.

## Continuously Improve

We grow our team through apprenticeship. We learn every day and we teach every day. Through humble introspection we gracefully fail fast and learn from our experience.
