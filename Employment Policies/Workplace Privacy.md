# Workspace Privacy

As an employer, it is DevMynd’s goal to monitor or track our employees in as few ways as possible. We want DevMynd team members to feel a sense of ownership towards their personal workspaces and be comfortable at the office. However, in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our team, company property (e.g. desks, laptops, and other devices) is subject to search. For instance, this might be used if management learns that an employee has brought a gun to work or has stolen company property.

This means that while the company will always try to respect employee privacy, employees do not have a right to privacy in their workspaces in any property that belongs to DevMynd. The company reserves the right to search company property at any time, without warning, to ensure compliance with our policies, including those that cover employee safety, workplace violence, harassment, theft, and possession of prohibited items. If you use a lock on any item of company property, you must give a copy of the key or combination to a member of management.

## Email and Internet Privacy

DevMynd email communications and Internet traffic are not being actively monitored by anyone, but because they are company resources that are managed according to company policy, you should not expect privacy from either. The company has both the ability and the right to look at employee usage for both in order to protect employee safety and wellbeing, as well as company property and interests.

## Email Is Not Private

Email messages, including attachments, sent and received from a DevMynd email address are the property of DevMynd. We reserve the right to access, monitor, read, and/or copy email messages at any time, for any reason. You should not expect privacy for any email you send using your DevMynd email, including messages that you consider to be personal or label with a designation such as “Personal” or “Private.”

## Use of the Email System for Personal Email

The email system is intended for official company business. If you send personal messages through the company’s email system, you must exercise discretion as to the number and type of messages you send.

## All Conduct Rules Apply to Email and Chat

All of our [policies and rules of conduct](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Code%20of%20Conduct.md) apply to employee use of the email, chat and other communication systems. This means, for example, that you may not use the email, chat, or other communication systems to send harassing or discriminatory messages, including messages with explicit sexual content or pornographic images; to send threatening messages; or to reveal company trade secrets.

## Professional Tone and Content

We expect you to exercise discretion in using electronic communications. When you send email using a DevMynd email address or DevMynd social account, you are representing DevMynd. Make sure that your messages are professional and appropriate, in both tone and content. Remember, although email or social media may seem like a private conversation, they can be printed, saved, and forwarded to unintended recipients. You should not send any email/message/update/etc. that you wouldn’t want our team, your family, or our competitors to read.

## Internet Use Is Not Private

We reserve the right to monitor employee use of the Internet at any time. You should not expect that your use of the Internet—including but not limited to the sites you visit, the amount of time you spend online, and the communications you have—will be private.
