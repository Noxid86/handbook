# Diversity and Equal Opportunity

## Equal Opportunity Employment

DevMynd is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The company supports diversity and inclusion in its core values and does not discriminate against qualified employees or applicants on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, disability, protected genetic information, age, religion, marital status, veteran status, height, weight, sexual orientation, gender expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local ordinance.

## Diversity Policy

**DevMynd is committed to creating a workforce that reflects the
diversity found in our society.** We employ a lot of great people who do
many different types of work. Our development and design departments
contain the largest number of employees, and are ably assisted by our
sales, administrative, and executive departments. Our goal is equity and
diversity within each department, and also across the company as a
whole.

**DevMynd recognizes** that our society contains systemic barriers that
deny access, opportunity, and participation to certain disadvantaged and
underrepresented groups. The technology industry, in particular, has
extensive structural issues that make it difficult for gender
minorities, underrepresented racial groups, and people with disabilities
to participate fully.

**DevMynd recognizes** further that we can build better, more
meaningful, and higher-quality software when we have an equitable work
environment and a diverse staff at all levels, and within all
departments. Diversity drives our growth.

**Therefore**, as both a business and a human imperative, DevMynd is
committed to equity in recruitment, hiring, training, professional
development, and advancement. We will identify and determine ways to
remove existing employment and advancement barriers, and take positive
steps to attract and assist the integration and full participation of
underrepresented groups.

To this end, we have identified some barriers to full participation from
underrepresented groups, and metrics that will help us track the
effectiveness of our work.

### Barriers

Barriers that may affect the ways in which people are able to access the
opportunities and benefits that DevMynd offers include:

* Information (if DevMynd does not have information about diverse
  communities or vice versa)
* Connections (if minority groups are not part of the network with which
  DevMynd connects)
* Experience and expertise (if diverse experiences are not valued by the
  organization)
* Decision-making (if underrepresented groups are excluded from decision
  making process)

The leadership team will generate a set of strategies to lessen the
influence of each of these barriers. They will review and update these
strategies quarterly, or more often as required.

[TODO: specifics about what we plan to do for each]

### Metrics

We will collect these metrics per group, as well as company-wide. The
leadership team will update and review these quarterly, or more often as
required.
