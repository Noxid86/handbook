# Drugs and Alcohol

Our priority at DevMynd is to create a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make work at DevMynd feel safe.

Alcohol may be available at company events or on Friday evenings at the office but **it is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe.**  The presence or consumption of alcohol in no way excuses violations of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/devmynd/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Code%20of%20Conduct.md).

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed while at work, either in the office or outside of the office while representing DevMynd.  Activity of a criminal nature will reflect poorly on future employment and may result in termination.
