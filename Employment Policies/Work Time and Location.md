# Work Time and Location

At DevMynd we organize into small project teams and as such things move very quickly and decisions are made or reversed as new information guides us.  This makes it difficult to keep up with team progress for anyone who isn't in the office participating in conversations and high-bandwidth collaboration.  As a result, we put a high premium on physical co-location. However, we also recognize the benefits and attractiveness of flexibility in work time and environment.

## Expected Work Hours per Week

Employees are expected to work a minimum of 40 hours per week but are not expected to work significantly beyond 40 hours.  The spirit of this goal is that we will commit the majority of our working time to producing value for customers or for the company.  Employees should never exceed 50 hours of work in a given week.  If you feel that the completion of your tasks require more than 50 hours on a regular basis this should be addressed with management and mitigated to avoid burn out and lower quality of work.

## Core Hours

Whether co-locating at company or client offices, or working remotely, our core working hours are from 10am to 4pm local time.  This means that during core hours employees are expected to be present and ready for work (not just in the building preparing for work).  This does not mean however that these are the only times that employees are expected to be working.  Having core hours helps us set expectations that pair programming and collaboration will be possible during the majority of the work day. However, it is up to employee's discretion how they make up time outside of core hours, whether this be earlier mornings, later evenings, or weekends (though weekend work is not recommended).

## Remote Days

One day each week is an optional "work remote" day for the company. This means that you are not asked to come in to the company's office. However, this does not exclude team members from core hours and everyone should be available online for pair programming, collaboration, and daily standup meetings while working remotely.  Further, these days should not impede client work and any meetings with clients (whether on-site or remote) should continue to occur as scheduled.

## Work-from-Home or Out-of-Office

Occasionally it is necessary to be home or be out of the office during core hours - receiving important packages, childcare, doctors appointments, etc.  In the event of the need to work from home employees are expected to: 1) minimize this time and it's impact to work productivity, and 2) let team leads and clients know ahead of time at the earliest possible opportunity.  If you need to be away from work, and not working, for a period of 3 hours or more this should be considered paid-time-off (PTO) and should be recorded as such.
