# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all DevMynd team members while performing work for or representing DevMynd (whether in company offices, in the community, or at client sites) and at all events hosted or sponsored by DevMynd.  Further, this code applies equally to digital interactions such as any company email or chat and any company owned social media accounts or personal social communications which represent DevMynd.

Our company is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workplace and community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for the workplace, any work related function, Twitter and other online media that is sponsored by the company or which represents the company.  Violation of this policy will be considered a serious matter.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of conversation, interactions, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and any other provocative behavior which is deemed to be inappropriate or undesirable.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary statements and jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive speech is not appropriate and will be considered a serious matter.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact JC (jc@devmynd.com) or one of the other members of the leadership team immediately.
